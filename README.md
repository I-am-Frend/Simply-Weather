## Testing

I have tested the site in the following browsers; Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox, it worked the same in all three browsers.

I confrimed that my page is responsive via the devtools in Chrome, I also tested the site on my phone.

I have confirmed that the links open up to the corresponding sites and in a new browser window.

I have confirmed that the form works and requires an email to beable to submit, and I used a custom response page to redirect the user.
