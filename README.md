### Features Left to Implement

- I would have liked to have a list of weather forecasts underneath the main app
- A simple header 
- Humidity text 

## Testing

I have tested the site in the following browsers; Chrome, Microsoft Edge, it worked the same in both browsers.

I confrimed that my app is responsive via the devtools in Chrome, I also tested the app on my phone.

The testing of the API calling was a extremely exhausting process, but eventually I managed to figure it out.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
- JSHint
  - The JS Code passed though JSHint with no issues, but gave me a few warnings about things I could do better.
- Accessibility

I used W3Schools to solve the ever growing riddle of how i wanted call and impliment a API into Javascript.
